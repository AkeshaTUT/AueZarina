# Steam Wishlist JSON Decoding Error - Fix Summary

## Problem
The bot was experiencing an error when trying to process Steam Wishlist data:
```
2025-07-26 17:22:55,398 - steam_wishlist - ERROR - Error getting wishlist data: 0, message='Attempt to decode JSON with unexpected mimetype: text/html; charset=utf-8', url=URL('https://store.steampowered.com/')
```

This error occurred because Steam was returning HTML content instead of JSON, typically due to:
- Private profiles or wishlists
- Invalid Steam IDs
- Rate limiting or bot detection
- Redirects to error pages

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in `get_wishlist_data()`:
- Added content-type checking before attempting JSON decoding
- Added detailed logging for response analysis
- Added specific error handling for private profiles (403) and not found (404)
- Added timeout handling
- Better Steam ID64 validation

### 2. Improved Steam ID Resolution in `resolve_steam_id()`:
- Added better error detection for non-existent profiles
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- Added timeout handling
- Better Steam ID64 format validation

### 3. Enhanced Price Information Retrieval in `get_game_price_info()`:
- Added content-type validation
- Added Russian region parameter (`cc=ru`) for proper pricing
- Better error handling and logging
- Timeout handling

### 4. Improved Wishlist Processing in `check_wishlist_discounts()`:
- Added progress logging
- Increased delays between requests to avoid rate limiting (1 second vs 0.5)
- Better empty wishlist handling
- More informative logging

### 5. Enhanced Bot User Interface:
- Added URL validation before processing
- More detailed error messages for users
- Better guidance on how to fix profile privacy settings
- Step-by-step instructions for making profiles public

### 6. Added ClientSession Configuration:
- Added proper timeout configuration (30s total, 10s connect)
- Better connection management

## Technical Improvements

### Better Headers:
```python
headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36',
    'Accept': 'application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01',
    'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.9',
    'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br',
    'Connection': 'keep-alive',
    'Sec-Fetch-Dest': 'empty',
    'Sec-Fetch-Mode': 'cors',
    'Sec-Fetch-Site': 'same-origin',
}
```

### Content-Type Validation:
```python
if 'application/json' in content_type or 'text/javascript' in content_type:
    data = await response.json()
else:
    # Handle HTML responses appropriately
```

### Enhanced Error Messages:
Users now receive specific guidance on:
- How to make their Steam profile public
- Privacy settings location
- Common causes of wishlist access issues
- Step-by-step troubleshooting

## Result
The bot now properly handles:
- Private Steam profiles
- Invalid profile URLs
- Empty wishlists
- Steam API errors
- Network timeouts
- Rate limiting

Users receive clear, actionable error messages instead of generic failures.
